# SAP Commerce Cloud, open payment framework SDK

## About this project

Development of custom addon(s) on the SAP Commerce Accelerator storefront that can be shipped/delivered to customers in a standalone mode so that implementation partners/customers can apply these addons to their existing storefront application with minimal customization/configurations to replace the legacy payment integration approach and use the OPF based payment providers. The addon shall be delivered with the integration capabilities to all OPF APIs that are necessary for the end-end payment flow. Customers need to perform an implementation of the addon on their storefronts which shall mostly be configuration and testing effort* to replace the existing payment flows via custom developments. A new checkout flow shall be introduced for the OPF integration such that A/B testing shall be possible to validate the new OPF integration in terms of payment authorization/capture and order placement.
